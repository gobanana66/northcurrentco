      <h1>About North Current</h1>
<p><strong>Made for the moment.</strong></p>
<p>North Current was born out of friendship, creative restlessness, and a deep pull toward something more grounded—more real. We’re two designers who met in university while studying for our Bachelor of Design, and bonded over a love of clean lines, honest work, and the feeling you get when you're exactly where you’re meant to be.</p>
<p>Ivana grew up in the rugged beauty of Northeastern Ontario—where the lakes are deep, the pines run tall, and “north” is more than a direction; it’s a way of life. Anna moved to Canada as a child and has called Toronto home ever since, bringing with her a story shaped by movement, creativity, and quiet resilience across cultures and generations.</p>
<p>Together, we created North Current as a lifestyle brand that captures the in-between: between nature and design, tradition and trend, stillness and momentum. It’s for those drawn to wildness and to moments that matter—whether on the dock, on the trail, or at the kitchen table.</p>
<p>We started with a handful of thoughtfully designed tees and home goods—products that feel as good as they look, and carry a little of the wilderness with them. Everything we create is made to live with you: soft enough to relax in, strong enough to hold meaning, and timeless enough to last.</p>
<p>Proudly women-owned and independently run, North Current is shaped by our lived experiences, our roots, and our shared eye for thoughtful design.</p>
<p>We believe in good design, wild places, and the quiet magic of now.</p>
<p><strong>Welcome to the current.</strong></p>

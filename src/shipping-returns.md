# Shipping & Returns

## Shipping

All of our items are made to order, which helps us reduce waste and create only what’s needed. Here’s what you can expect:

### Processing Time

Orders are typically fulfilled within **2–5 business days**.

### Estimated Shipping Times

- **Canada & U.S.:** 3–10 business days
- **International:** 10–20 business days (varies by destination)

### Tracking

Once your order ships, you’ll receive a tracking number by email. Please note that processing and shipping times are estimates and may vary due to carrier delays or high-volume seasons.

### International Orders

Import duties, taxes, or customs fees may apply depending on your country. These charges are the responsibility of the customer.

## Returns & Exchanges

Because all items are made to order, we do not accept returns or exchanges for reasons such as wrong size, change of mind, or buyer’s remorse.

However, if your order arrives **damaged, misprinted, or incorrect**, we’ll make it right. Please contact us within **7 days of delivery** with the following:

- A brief description of the issue
- Clear photos of the item and any damage
- Your order number

We’ll be happy to replace the item or offer a refund if appropriate.

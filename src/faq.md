# Frequently Asked Questions

### Where are your products made?

Our products are designed in Canada and fulfilled through trusted print-on-demand partners with global facilities. This allows us to reduce waste and produce only what’s needed.

### How long will my order take to ship?

Because each item is custom made, here’s what to expect:

- **Production time:** 2–5 business days
- **Shipping time:**
  - Canada & U.S.: 3–10 business days
  - International: 10–20 business days (varies by location)

You’ll receive tracking information by email once your order ships.

### Do you ship internationally?

Yes, we do! International delivery times and fees vary by destination. Please note that customs or import duties may apply and are the responsibility of the buyer.

### How do I choose the right size?

Every product page includes a detailed size guide. For best results, measure one of your favorite items at home and compare it to the chart before ordering.

### Can I return or exchange my order?

Because each item is made just for you, we are unable to accept returns or size exchanges. However, if your order arrives damaged, defective, or incorrect, we’ll make it right. Just contact us within 7 days of delivery with a description and photo of the issue.

### How do I care for my apparel?

To keep your items looking their best:

- Machine wash cold, inside-out, on a gentle cycle
- Use mild detergent and avoid fabric softeners
- Tumble dry low or hang to dry
- Do not bleach or iron directly on the design

Proper care helps extend the life of your garment and preserves print quality.
